If I were to say something about myself, it would probably be like...
> Hi! My Name is Inderpreet Singh and I am an electronics engineer. by profession. I am also a researcher and teacher at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar.

> In the past two decades, I have done some work in the field of electronics and software design as well as a little something in the field of embedded systems design as well. This is where I post details on projects that I am doing or have completed as well as tutorial and guides for everyone.

> Being an electronics engineer, I also feel the need to extend my thoughts to others and to help other engineers in any way possible. I have always tried to design and develop systems and instruments that students/hobbyist can make and use. The purpose is to prove that to start doing good work, we donâ€™t need to spend a fortune. There are a lot of resources out there and lots of people doing really great work. My field of work is not constrained to one field but rather many fields put together. I have experience in the field of Embedded Controllers, Communications, FPGA based systems, System on Programmable Chip, Programming, CAD tools, VLSI etc. The list is long because I am always interested in learning new things. I put up my work and ideas for others to see and if you see any room for improvement, I am all ears.

That being said, I would love feedback and if you like my content, like and subscribe my youtube channel and/or buy me a coffee. Donate via [paypal.me/IPv1](https://paypal.me/IPv1)
