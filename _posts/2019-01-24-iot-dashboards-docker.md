## Description

For those concerned with privacy and yet want to experiment with IoT, this tutorial guides you through creating a dashboard using Grafana and InfluxDB. The implementation is done using docker and is cross platform. The code is accompanied with the write-up on [Howto: Docker, Databases, and Dashboards to Deal with Your Data](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/23/howto-docker-databases-and-dashboards-to-deal-with-your-data/) at Hack-a-day
