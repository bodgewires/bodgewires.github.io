An enclosure to protect the ARTY FPGA board while making it useful.

## Description

This is a small CAD project where an enclosure was designed and 3D printed to demonstrate competency with the mechanical aspect of product design

## Details

An enclosure is a necessary to protect electronic boards from damage. Needless to say a lot of kit makers do not provide the required casing nor the instructions. With 3D printing, some of us can take the DIY route and in my case, I made an enclosure for the Digilent ARTY Board.

As a mini project, I took it upon myself to create a small cover for the said board and the stl file can be downloaded from the link below. The cover requires a cardboard piece to be cut and fitted to act as a base. This was made so that the base could be replaced by materials of user's choice and varied in size.

## Lessons Learned

The tool of choice was Fusion 360 and the design came out fine. I would like the mention that though the design worked the first time around, many-a-times it may go through iterations to fine tune everything.
