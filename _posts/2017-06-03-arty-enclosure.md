## INTRODUCTION

An enclosure is a necessary to protect electronic boards from damage. Needless to say a lot of kit makers do not provide the required casing nor the instructions. With 3D printing, some of us can take the DIY route and in my case, I made an enclosure for the Digilent ARTY Board.

As a mini project, I took it upon myself to create a small cover for the said board and the stl file can be downloaded from the link below. The cover requires a cardboard piece to be cut and fitted to act as a base. This was made so that the base could be replaced by materials of user's choice and varied in size.

Let me know how it works out for you in the comments below. 

Happy hacking.
