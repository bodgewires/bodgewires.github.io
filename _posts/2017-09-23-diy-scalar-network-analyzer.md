Research need not be expensive and this projects helps a little.

## Description

Electrical Network Analyzers are expensive though in this writeup, I take up the task of creating a lower spec version of the instrument. The write-up at [Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2017/09/22/network-analysers-the-electrical-kind/) takes a quick look at the fundamentals of network analyzers and then attempts to create a diy version with the architecture in mind.

Head on over to the Hack-a-day site for the complete details.
