## Description

In this two part series, I create a Bluetooth 4.0 Solution for controlling LEDs using a standard laptop. The project stands as a proof of concept for interfacing BLE devices and can be extended to other applications.

The first part about [Beginning BLE Experiments And Making Everything Better](https://hackaday.com/2018/08/03/beginning-ble-experiments-and-making-everything-better/) talks about the fundamentals of BLE 4.0 communications such as the GATT and GAP system. I discuss existing hardware as well as custom modules that can be used for experimentation.

Next we dive deeper by creating an application that can be remote controlled and [How to Mash Up BLE, NodeJS, and MQTT to Get Internet of Things](https://hackaday.com/2018/08/24/how-to-mash-up-ble-nodejs-and-mqtt-to-get-internet-of-things/)

Here is a demo video
