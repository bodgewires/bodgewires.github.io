## Description

LEDs are everywhere and they may seem tame, they can be hard to control beasts. I wrote about the [basics of LEDs](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/08/know-thy-led/) and the research that goes into the design of the LED and it's emitted color. To take this knowledge into the applied sciences, I add by reading datasheets, simulating drive circuits and then present a demonstration of LED control using PWM. I even talk about dedicated LED driver chips and how to make your own [LED Control](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/29/control-thy-led/)
